# Economic-Statistics-of-the-World
In this project, we will explore economic statistics from countries around the world. From the World Bank website, we have collected the following statistics from the year 2018: electricity access (% of population), fertility rate (births per woman), GDP per capita, and life expectancy. The countries are divided into seven regions.
